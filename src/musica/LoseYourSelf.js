{"\n"}Look{"\n"}
If you had{"\n"}
One shot{"\n"}
Or one opportunity{"\n"}
To seize everything you ever wanted{"\n"}
In one moment{"\n"}
Would you capture it{"\n"}
Or just let it slip?{"\n"}
Yo{"\n"}{"\n"}
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy{"\n"}
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti{"\n"}
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready{"\n"}
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'{"\n"}
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud{"\n"}
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out{"\n"}
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now{"\n"}
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow{"\n"}
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity{"\n"}
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked{"\n"}
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No{"\n"}
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes{"\n"}
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke{"\n"}
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's{"\n"}
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody{"\n"}
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him{"\n"}{"\n"}
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment{"\n"}
You own it, you better never let it go{"\n"}
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow{"\n"}
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime{"\n"}{"\n"}
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment{"\n"}
You own it, you better never let it go{"\n"}
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow{"\n"}
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime{"\n"}
You better{"\n"}{"\n"}
His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping{"\n"}
This world is mine for the taking{"\n"}
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order{"\n"}
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortem{"\n"}
It only grows harder, only grows hotter{"\n"}
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him{"\n"}
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter{"\n"}
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father{"\n"}
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter{"\n"}
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water{"\n"}
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product{"\n"}
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada{"\n"}
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on{"\n"}
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da{"\n"}{"\n"}
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment{"\n"}
You own it, you better never let it go{"\n"}
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow{"\n"}
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime{"\n"}{"\n"}
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment{"\n"}
You own it, you better never let it go{"\n"}
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow{"\n"}
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime{"\n"}
You better{"\n"}{"\n"}
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage{"\n"}
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged{"\n"}
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed{"\n"}
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage{"\n"}
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher{"\n"}
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper{"\n"}
All the pain inside amplified by the{"\n"}
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to{"\n"}
Five and I can't provide the right type of{"\n"}
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers{"\n"}
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer{"\n"}
This is my life and these times are so hard{"\n"}
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus{"\n"}
Teeter totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna{"\n"}
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much{"\n"}
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's{"\n"}
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got{"\n"}
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot{"\n"}
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not{"\n"}
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot{"\n"}
So here I go, is my shot{"\n"}
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got{"\n"}{"\n"}
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment{"\n"}
You own it, you better never let it go{"\n"}
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow{"\n"}

You can do anything you set your mind to, man</Text>
